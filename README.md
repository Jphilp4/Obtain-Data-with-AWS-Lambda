# ⚡ Serverless Data Retrieval with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB

---

## Project Overview  
I built a lightweight serverless function using **AWS Lambda** to query data from **DynamoDB**. This project demonstrates how to retrieve user data on-demand without worrying about any backend infrastructure.

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:  
- 🗂️ **Created DynamoDB Table**: Set up a NoSQL table to store user data.  
- 🧠 **Developed AWS Lambda Function**: Wrote logic to query DynamoDB based on user input.  
- 🧪 **Tested with Lambda Events**: Simulated data retrieval scenarios using test events in Lambda.  
- 🔐 **Configured IAM Role Permissions**: Updated Lambda’s execution role to securely access DynamoDB.  
- 📊 **Monitored via CloudWatch Logs**: Verified function execution and troubleshooting logs.

### Skills  
- Serverless Architecture  
- Event-Driven Computing  
- Data Querying with DynamoDB  
- IAM Role & Policy Configuration  
- Serverless Testing & Debugging

## Why Lambda + DynamoDB?  
By using **Lambda** and **DynamoDB**, I created a **cost-effective**, **real-time**, and **scalable** data retrieval system without deploying or managing servers. This approach is ideal for applications requiring fast reads, low latency, and simple data access patterns.
